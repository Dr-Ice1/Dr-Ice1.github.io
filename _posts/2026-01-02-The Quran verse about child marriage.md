## Introduction

In this article we will examine Surah 65 verse 4. First we will look at the context around the Surah, look at the verse, do some exegesis and look at some scholars, and finally draw a conclusion.

## Context

Surah 65 is called At Talaq, meaning divorce, it talks about how divorce should be handled in Islam. Here is the first verse of the chapter:

> O Prophet (SAW)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their **‘Iddah (prescribed periods)**, and count (accurately) their ‘Iddah (periods). And fear Allah your Lord (O Muslims), and turn them not out of their (husband’s) homes, nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open illegal sexual intercourse. And those are the set limits of Allah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself. You (the one who divorces his wife) know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass (i.e. to return her back to you if that was the first or second divorce).
> 
> [Quran 65:1](https://quranx.com/65.1) by Hilali & Khan

Notice how the ‘Iddah period is a period a woman has to wait after divorce[^1], however **the condition is consummation**, others wise no ‘Iddah period is necessary ([Quran 33:49](https://quranx.com/33.49)). So when an Islamic divorced woman wants to remarry, she has to wait a certain amount of time before she can do that.

## The verse

Chapter 65 verse 4 of the Quran says:

> And those of your women as have **passed the age of monthly courses**, for them the ‘Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubts (about their periods), is three months, and for those who have **no courses** \[(i.e. they are still **immature**) their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death]. And for those who are **pregnant** (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is until they deliver (their burdens), and whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him.
> 
> [Quran 65:4](https://quranx.com/65.4) by Hilali & Khan


<br><br>
In this verse we read about three categories of women and their prescribed waiting periods (‘Iddah). The first category talks about those who are too old for their monthly courses, the third category talks about pregnant women, and the second category covers those who have not menstruated. In this particular translation, the two scholars who have translated the verse added in brackets some clarification for the reader about the meaning of _those who have no courses_. They want to clarify what their translation means and explicitly state it talks about immature children. This is the first piece of evidence that shows the true meaning of this verse and how scholars interpret and translate it.

## Exegesis and Scholarly interpretation

Muslims will usually try to argue that this verse couldn’t possibly talk about prepubescent girls, since it says _And those of your women_ at the beginning of the verse. This argument can be refuted with some exegesis of how the word _women_ is used in other places in the Quran. In [Quran 2:49](https://quranx.com/2.49) we read:

> And (remember) when We delivered you from Fir’aun’s (Pharaoh) people, who were afflicting you with a horrible torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and therein was a mighty trial from your Lord.
> 
> [Quran 2:49](https://quranx.com/2.49) by Hilali & Khan

In the context of this verse we can see that _your women_ refers to both mature and immature women. The root of the word is the same in both verses ([65:4.6](https://quranx.com/analysis/65.4), [2:49.12](https://quranx.com/analysis/2.49)).

Now we will look at the interpretation of the scholars, in the [tafsirs](https://quranx.com/tafsirs/65.4) we read:

> (And for such of your women as despair of menstruation) because of old age, (if ye doubt) about their waiting period, (their period (of waiting) shall be three months) upon which another man asked: “O Messenger of Allah! What about the waiting period of **those who do not have menstruation because they are too young?**” (along with those who have it not) because of young age, **their waiting period is three months.** Another man asked: “what is the waiting period for those women who are pregnant?” (And for those with child) i.e. those who are pregnant, (their period) their waiting period (shall be till they bring forth their burden) their child. (And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah) and whoever fears Allah regarding what he commands him, (He maketh his course easy for him) He makes his matter easy; and it is also said this means: He will help him to worship Him well.

<br><br>
> And [as for] those of your women who (read allā’ī or allā’i in both instances) no longer expect to menstruate, if you have any doubts, about their waiting period, their prescribed [waiting] period shall be three months, and [also for] **those who have not yet menstruated, because of their young age, their period shall [also] be three months** — both cases apply to other than those whose spouses have died; for these [latter] their period is prescribed in the verse: they shall wait by themselves for four months and ten [days] [Q. 2:234]. And those who are pregnant, their term, the conclusion of their prescribed [waiting] period if divorced or if their spouses be dead, shall be when they deliver. And whoever fears God, He will make matters ease for him, in this world and in the Hereafter.

> The \`Iddah of Those in Menopause and Those Who do not have Menses
> 
> Allah the Exalted clarifies the waiting period of the woman in menopause. And that is the one whose menstruation has stopped due to her older age. Her \`Iddah is three months instead of the three monthly cycles for those who menstruate, which is based upon the Ayah in (Surat) Al-Baqarah. see 2:228 **The same for the young, who have not reached the years of menstruation. Their \`Iddah is three months like those in menopause.** This is the meaning of His saying;

Here we read three scholars who all agree on the meaning, of _those who have no courses_, is prepubescent girls. So what does this mean according to the scholars in practical terms? Here we read another scholar:

> Here, one should bear in mind the fact that according to the explanations given in the Qur’an the question of the waiting period arises in respect of the women with whom marriage may have been consummated, for there is no waiting-period in case divorce is pronounced before the consummation of marriage. (Al-Ahzab: 49). Therefore, **making mention of the waiting-period for the girls who have not yet menstruated, ==clearly proves that it is not only permissible to give away the girl in marriage at this age but it is also permissible for the husband to consummate marriage with her==. Now, obviously no Muslim has the right to forbid a thing which the Qur’an has held as permissible.**

The reason for this supposed revelation of Allah is because:

> (And for such of your women as despair of menstruation…) [65:4]. Said Muqatil: “When the verse (Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart…), Kallad ibn al-Nu‘man ibn Qays al-Ansari said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, what is the waiting period of the woman who does not menstruate and the woman who has not menstruated yet? And what is the waiting period of the pregnant woman?’ And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”. Abu Ishaq al-Muqri’ informed us> Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn Hamdun> Makki ibn ‘Abdan> Abu’l-Azhar> Asbat ibn Muhammad> Mutarrif> Abu ‘Uthman ‘Amr ibn Salim who said: “When the waiting period for divorced and widowed women was mentioned in Surah al-Baqarah, Ubayy ibn Ka‘b said: ‘**O Messenger of Allah, some women of Medina are saying: there are other women who have not been mentioned!’ He asked him: ‘And who are they?’ He said: ‘Those who are too young** [such that they have not started menstruating yet], those who are too old [whose menstruation has stopped] and those who are pregnant’. And so this verse (And for such of your women as despair of menstruation…) was revealed”.

> Commentaries for [65.4](https://quranx.com/65.4) by Wahidi – Asbab Al-Nuzul by Al-Wahidi

Here the three categories are confirmed and the reason for this verse is because there were women concerned about the divorce laws for little children who have not yet menstruated. The reason they were asking this was because the marriage and divorce was already happening with small children and those people needed a ruling from Allah and his messenger.

## Conclusion

The meaning of this verse can be interpreted by any sane and critically thinking human being, which of course the Muslims will deny. So we can just show their scholars who explain it and even give accounts of the reason for the verse.
