# The Quranic claim

> Then (do) not they ponder (on) the Quran? And if it had (been) (of) from other than Allah, surely they (would have) found in it contradiction, much.
>
> S. 4:82 Corups

> Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it had been from [any] other than Allah, they would have found within it much contradiction.
>
> S. 4:82 Sahih International

Already we find two issues with this verse:

1. The verse states 'much contradiction', so if we find only **some** contradiction, this would not be sufficient apparently. Which seems as if the author of the Quran is not certain that his book is without contradictions.
2. A book not having contradictions does not make it divine.

# 1: Quran verses contradicting

> It is He who created for you all that is in the earth, then He lifted Himself to heaven and levelled them seven heavens; and He has knowledge of everything.
>
> S. 2:29 Arberry

> Are ye the harder to create, or is the heaven that He built? He raised the height thereof and ordered it; And He made dark the night thereof, and He brought forth the morn thereof. And after that He spread the earth. And produced therefrom the water thereof and the pasture thereof, And He made fast the hills, A provision for you and for your cattle.
>
> S. 79:27-33 Pickthall

In one verse Allah started from the earth and then continued with the heavens, in the other he started creating the heavens and then the earth. Either way one goes, one is true and the other must be false, since the Quran says both are true, this is a contradiction. Which ever verse you agree with, the other one must be wrong. 
# 2: Contradicting reality

> They will ask thee of Dhu'l-Qarneyn. Say: I shall recite unto you a remembrance of him. Lo! We made him strong in the land and gave him unto every thing a road. And he followed a road Till, when he reached the setting-place of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and found a people thereabout. We said: O Dhu'l-Qarneyn! Either punish or show them kindness.
>
> S. 18:83-86

Muslims might claim someone sees this and it might be an optical illusion because that is what he saw. But the issue with this explanation is that the verse is not told from Dhu'l's perspective, this is Allah saying what he found. Nowhere in the verse does it say that it appeared so to him. 

To support this inaccuracy further, the hadiths mention how this is to be understood and how Muhammad understood this verse. Note that in the hadith it has nothing to do with Dhu'l, it is just Muhammad answering the question of his companion.

> Narrated Abu Dharr: I was sitting behind the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) who was riding a donkey while the sun was setting. He asked: Do you know where this sets ? I replied: Allah and his Apostle know best. He said: It sets in a spring of warm water (Hamiyah).
>
> Sunan Abi Dawud 4002
> Grade: Sahih in chain (Al-Albani)
> https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4002

Side note, this chapter is a copy from the Alexander Romance, a story about Alexander the Great, who was a pagan.

# 3: Contradicting the Bible

Relevance: Islamic Dilemma

> O followers of the Book! do not exceed the limits in your religion, and do not speak (lies) against Allah, but (speak) the truth; the Messiah, Isa son of Marium is only an apostle of Allah and His Word which He communicated to Marium and a spirit from Him; believe therefore in Allah and His apostles, and say not, Three. Desist, it is better for you; Allah is only one Allah; far be It from His glory that He should have a son, whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His, and Allah is sufficient for a Protector.
>
> S. 4:171

> And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”
>
> Matthew 3:17

> 61 But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer.
>
> Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?”
>
> 62 “I am,” said Jesus. “And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
>
> Mark 14:61-62

Many other witnesses identify Jesus as the Son of God. After this cloud of witnesses has identified Christ as the Son of God, a caravan-dealer from 7th century Arabia comes and says "everyone is wrong I'm right" and "how can Allah have a son when he has no wife". The issue is that Allah confirms our Scriptures and affirms the preservation, revelation, and authority. Meaning two contradictory books are said to be the word of God by Allah, which makes one wonder which is the truth.

# 4: Versions of the Quran contradicting

> They (Messengers) said: "O Lout (Lot)! Verily, we are the Messengers from your Lord! They shall not reach you! So travel with your family in a part of the night, and let not any of you look back, but your wife (will remain behind), verily, the punishment which will afflict them, will afflict her. Indeed, morning is their appointed time. Is not the morning near?"
>
> S. 11:81 Hilali & Khan

> "They said, oh Lot, we are the envoys of thy Lord. They shall not reach thee. So set out with thy family during the night, and let none of you turn around save thy wife. Surely that which befalls them shall befall her? Indeed, the morning shall be their tryst. Is not the morning nigh?
>
> S. 11:81 The study Quran

So one says Lot's wife will stay behind and in the other it sounds like they all go out and only the wife turns around to look back. 

See video at 20:26 for the Arabic pronounciation.

The textual variant changes the meaning of "except thy wife" because in one version it is accusative and in the other normative. 

Now which version of these is preserved in the heavenly tablets?

# 5: Contradiction between abrogated verses

A few different contradictory verses will be shown here.

## 1

> There is no compulsion in religion. The right direction is henceforth distinct from error. And he who rejecteth false deities and believeth in Allah hath grasped a firm handhold which will never break. Allah is Hearer, Knower.
>
> S. 2:256 Pickthall

> Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger, and follow not the Religion of Truth, until they pay the tribute readily, being brought low.
>
> S. 9:29 Pickthall

## 2

> O ye who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken, till ye know that which ye utter, nor when ye are polluted, save when journeying upon the road, till ye have bathed. And if ye be ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have touched women, and ye find not water, then go to high clean soil and rub your faces and your hands (therewith). Lo! Allah is Benign, Forgiving.
>
> S. 4:43 Pickthall

> O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), gambling, Al-Ansab, and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaitan's (Satan) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.
>
> S. 5:90 Hilali & Khan

## 3

> And those of your women who commit illegal sexual intercourse, take the evidence of four witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them (i.e. women) to houses until death comes to them or Allah ordains for them some (other) way.
>
> S. 4:15 Hilali & Khan

> The woman and the man guilty of illegal sexual intercourse, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment. (This punishment is for unmarried persons guilty of the above crime but if married persons commit it, the punishment is to stone them to death, according to Allah's Law).
>
> S. 24:2

So in the heavenly eternal tablets these contradictory statements, which abrogate one another, are written.
