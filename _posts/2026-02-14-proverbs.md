# The Contention

INSTRUCTION OF AMENEMOPE [Instruction of Amenemope - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_of_Amenemope#HeroSection)

KORT : instructions of amenemope is een oude Egyptische wijsheid tekst die op zijn minst 500 en waarschijnlijk meer dan 2000 jaar eerder samengesteld was dan het bijbelboek spreuken (proverbs). Er zijn dusdanig veel overeenkomsten tussen deze tekst en het bijbelboek spreuken dat wetenschappers aannemen dat het bijbelboek spreuken enorm veel inspiratie heeft genomen van deze oude egyptische tekst

VOORBEELD: vers 22:20 van het bijbelboek spreuken was altijd een moeilijk te vertalen bijbelvers. het gaat als volgt: 

> 20 Heb ik u niet heerlijke dingen geschreven,met raadgevingen en kennis (herziene statenvertaling) [HSV - Website](https://herzienestatenvertaling.nl/teksten/spreuken/22#:~:text=20%20Heb%20ik%20u%20niet%20heerlijke%20dingen%20geschreven%2C,en%20vertrap%20de%20ellendige%20niet%20in%20de%20poort.)

King james version (1611) vertaalt het als 

> 20Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge, [Proverbs 22 KJV - A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than - Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2022&version=KJV)

de septuagint vertaalt het als 

> 20 καὶ σὺ δὲ ἀπόγραψαι αὐτὰ σεαυτῷ τρισσῶς εἰς βουλὴν καὶ γνῶσιν ἐπὶ τὸ πλάτος τῆς καρδίας σου.
> 
> 20 And do thou too repeatedly record them for thyself on the table of thine heart, for counsel and knowledge. [1 A fair name is better than much wealth, and good favour is above silver and g... PROVERBS / ΠΑΡΟΙΜΙΑΙ ΣΟΛΟΜΩΝΤΟΣ22 - Bilingual Septuagint](https://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/septuagint/chapter.asp?book=26&page=22)

  
Dit zijn allemaal vertalingen die compleet andere woorden gebruiken voor het woord wat er in het hebreeuws echt stond. namelijk het woord שָׁלִישִׁ֑ים (šā·lî·šîm) wat gewoon letterlijk ‘30’ betekent. In de septuagint wordt het vertaald met τρισσῶς (drievoud) in de kjv met excellent things en in de herziene statenvertaling met heerlijke dingen. Dit zijn allemaal ruime interpretaties die verschillen van elkaar en dat komt omdat tot honderd jaar geleden niemand echt wist wat het woord ‘30’ in deze zin deed en daarom werd het dus heel vrij geïnterpreteerd. 


Totdat de tekst instructions of amenemope werd gevonden ongeveer honderd jaar geleden en mensen de overeenkomsten zagen tussen dit oude egyptische wijsheidsboek en het bijbelboek spreuken. 

VOORBEELDEN VAN OVEREENKOMSTEN TUSSEN DE TWEE: 

---

> (Proverbs 22:17–18): "Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, And apply thine heart to my doctrine; For it is pleasant if thou keep them in thy belly, that they may be established together upon thy lips"

> (Amenemope, ch. 1): "Give thine ear, and hear what I say, And apply thine heart to apprehend; It is good for thee to place them in thine heart, let them rest in the casket of thy belly; That they may act as a peg upon thy tongue"


> (Proverbs 22:22): "Rob not the poor, for he is poor, neither oppress (or crush) the lowly in the gate."

> (Amenemope, ch. 2): "Beware of robbing the poor, and oppressing the afflicted."

> (Proverbs 22:24–5): "Do not befriend the man of anger, Nor go with a wrathful man, Lest thou learn his ways and take a snare for thy soul."

> (Amenemope, ch. 10): "Associate not with a passionate man, Nor approach him for conversation; Leap not to cleave to such an one; That terror carry thee not away."

> (Proverbs 22:29): "[if you] You see a man quick in his work, before kings will he stand, before cravens, he will not stand."

> (Amenemope, ch. 30): "A scribe who is skillful in his business findeth worthy to be a courtier"

> (Proverbs 23:1): "When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Consider diligently what is before thee; And put a knife to thy throat, If thou be a man given to appetite. Be not desirous of his dainties, for they are breads of falsehood."

> (Amenemope, ch. 23): "Eat not bread in the presence of a ruler, And lunge not forward(?) with thy mouth before a governor(?). When thou art replenished with that to which thou has no right, It is only a delight to thy spittle. Look upon the dish that is before thee, And let that (alone) supply thy need."


> (Proverbs 23:4–5): "Toil not to become rich, And cease from dishonest gain; For wealth maketh to itself wings, Like an eagle that flieth heavenwards"

> (Amenemope, ch. 7): "Toil not after riches; If stolen goods are brought to thee, they remain not over night with thee. They have made themselves wings like geese. And have flown into the heavens."


> (Proverbs 23:9): "Speak not in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of thy words"

> (Amenemope, ch. 21): "Empty not thine inmost soul to everyone, nor spoil (thereby) thine influence"

> (Proverbs 23:10): "Remove not the widows landmark; And enter not into the field of the fatherless."

> (Amenemope, ch. 6): "Remove not the landmark from the bounds of the field ... and violate not the widows boundary"

> (Proverbs 23:12): "Apply thine heart unto instruction and thine ears to the words of knowledge"

> (Amenemope, ch. 1): "Give thine ears, hear the words that are said, give thine heart to interpret them."

---

en wat blijkt nou, er zijn exact 30 hoofdstukken in the instructions of amenemope wat meteen een goede betekenis gaf aan het vers 22:20 van proverbs. Dit is waarom veel wetenschappers denken dat het boek proverbs enorm veel inspiratie heeft genomen van dit oude egyptische wijsheidsboek

  

IMPLICATIE: De verwevenheid van oude egyptische wijsheidsteksten en bijbelboeken suggereert dat de tekst via gewone menselijke literatuur processen tot stand is gekomen en niet via een persoon direct geïnspireerd is door een bovenmenselijk wezen. Ook is het opmerkelijk dat een bijbelboek inspiratie neemt uit literatuur van de egyptenaren, die polytheistisch waren en katten vereerden onder andere. Alhoewel het vereren van katten en dergelijke zaken niet is overgenomen in bijbelboeken gelukkig haha

# The Refutation

## Is Proverbs copied from Amenemope?

The differences between the texts[^1]:

```markdown
_Is There a Literary Dependence between the Writings?_

While the similarities are apparent in a side-by-side comparison, there are also numerous differences and other factors that caution against overplaying the potential link.

(1) _Difference in length and structure_. The Egyptian writing is much longer than this section of Proverbs. _Amenemope_ has thirty chapters that range from seven to twenty-six lines, while the Sayings of the Wise has around four lines per strophe. In addition, in their efforts to find parallels to match the thirty chapters, scholars often make artificial or dubious divisions in the Sayings of the Wise. Moreover, interpreters must view the preamble as the first “saying” in order to arrive at thirty, but the preamble is more likely to be distinguished literarily from what follows. This is also the case in _Amenemope_, where a three-stanza (48-line) introduction sets the context for the writing prior to the first chapter.

(2) _Difference in order_. The topics are arranged in a different sequence in the two texts. The Sayings of the Wise follows a progression from poverty/wealth to life/death. _Amenemope_, however, appears to follow a rather different course, moving from one ethical topic to another, usually centering on the three themes of property rights, civil strife, and conduct at the temple.  

(3) _Difference in theme_. Only around one-third of the chapters of _Amenemope_ (11 out of 30) bear some thematic correspondence to the Sayings of the Wise. In addition, the themes of both writings may be found in other ANE writings, such as the Mesopotamian wisdom writing _Counsels of Wisdom_ or the Egyptian writing _The Instruction of Ptahhotep_. Forcing correspondence to _Amenemope_ means that the author draws _only_ from that Egyptian writing, where there may have been other ANE writings the author had familiarity with.

(4) _Difference in theology_. The Sayings of the Wise carry a monotheistic orientation clearly centered upon YHWH. The divine name appears five times (22:19, 23; 23:17; 24:18, 21), along with references to YHWH as redeemer (23:11) and as the one who weighs hearts (24:12). _Amenemope_ carries a polytheistic framework, with references to numerous gods within the Egyptian pantheon, including Horus, Re, Shu, and others. In addition, the polytheistic impulse of _Amenemope_ is based on transactional power dynamics: the official-in-training must behave carefully so as to give no offense to the capriciously powerful gods. The Sayings of the Wise, on the other hand, recognize God’s role as being on the side of the weak and marginalized: He will bring them justice as their advocate (22:23; 23:11) and will show them compassion even when they are enemies (24:18). YHWH is thus to be feared above all because of his sovereign power (23:17; 24:21).

(5) _Required emendation_. Much of the alleged dependence derives from a questionable understanding of the word _thirty_ in Proverbs 22:20 as correlating with the thirty chapters of _Amenemope_. The word often emended to “thirty” is understood best as a reference to the “officers” who are being trained in the royal court. The plural form of “the wise” in the heading “Sayings of the Wise” presupposes that under the divine inspiration of the biblical text the author of Proverbs 22:17–24:22—whether Solomon or a later sage—is reshaping material from multiple intellectuals. For this reason, _Amenemope_, together with other wisdom writings available to the final author(s) of Proverbs, may have been drawn upon and reworked without necessitating a charge of “plagiarism” on outside sources.
```

Taking these differences into account we can see that the book of Proverbs was not necessarily copying from Amenemope. There is further evidence that Proverbs could be viewed as similar to other texts[^2]:

```Markdown
Here is one example of a similarity between Proverbs and the Instruction of Amenemope:  
  
“Do not rob the poor because he is poor,  
Or crush the afflicted at the gate” ([Proverbs 22:22, NASB](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/22/Proverbs-22-22.html)).  
  
“Guard yourself from robbing the poor  
From being violent to the weak” (Amenemope iv, 4–5).  
  
Obviously, these two passages contain similar thoughts. But, just as obviously, there is no direct copying involved. Also, it doesn’t follow that one author must have borrowed from the other. Isn’t it possible that two people, writing rules of wisdom, would both touch on the necessity of justice for the downtrodden?  
  
Another example:  
  
“For wealth certainly makes itself wings  
Like an eagle that flies toward the heavens” ([Proverbs 23:5, NASB](https://www.bibleref.com/Proverbs/23/Proverbs-23-5.html)).  
  
“They [dishonest riches] make themselves wings like geese,  
And fly to heaven” (Amenemope x, 5)  
  
Again, we can see that no direct copying took place, although the two passages deal with a common theme and both use a simile related to birds. One difference is that, in context, Solomon is speaking of a general desire for increased wealth, while Amenemope is speaking specifically of ill-gotten gains. As for the bird-based simile, such a figure of speech seems to have been common in the Near East, as it is found in other ancient writings, too. The use of a bird in flight to illustrate the transitory nature of things is also used in [Hosea 9:11](https://www.bibleref.com/Hosea/9/Hosea-9-11.html).
```

Also:

```markdown
According to [Ecclesiastes 12:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Ecclesiastes/12/Ecclesiastes-12-9.html), Solomon “pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs,” which could mean he was a compiler of proverbs from many different cultures.
```

We can assume that many proverbs are from different people in different times as is stated in the book itself[^3]:

>These also are **sayings of the wise**. Partiality in judging is not good.
>
>Proverbs 24:23

> to understand a proverb and a saying,  
>     **the words of the wise** and their riddles.
> 
> Proverbs 1:6

> Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise,  
>     and apply your heart to my knowledge,
> 
> Proverbs 22:17

Also Michael S. Heiser notes[^3]:

```markdown
At least one anonymous sage did contribute to Proverbs. Portions of Proverbs 22–23 come from an Egyptian wisdom text composed before Solomon’s lifetime, The Instruction of Amenemope.
```

There is, as was the case historically, still debate about the attributors of the Book of Proverbs. There are also superscriptions which suggest different authors[^4]:

1. 1:1: The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel
2. 10:1: The proverbs of Solomon
3. 22:17: The words of the wise
4. 24:23: These sayings also are from the wise
5. 25:1: These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of King Hezekiah of Judah copied
6. 30:1: The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh; an oracle
7. 31:1: The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him

Again[^4]:

```markdown
Note that the Hebrew word translated “composed” in v. 32 literally means “spoke.” The verse does not require that Solomon personally created or invented 3,000 proverbs, merely that he spoke them.
```

The verses from Proverbs which can be linked to Amenemope are in Proverbs 22:17-24:22, but verses 22:23, 26, 27; 23:13, 14 do not parallel the Egyptian text[^4].

A. K. Helmbold argues that both texts could be common to a more ancient text[^4]:

```markdown
Various studies of the lexicography of _Amenemope_ tend to indicate the Egypto-Semitic vocabulary belongs to the late stage of the Egyptian language. There are some indications that _Amenemope_ is closer to the LXX than to the MT. Although debated by some, the use of Semitic idioms could also indicate the precedence of Proverbs. The section Prov. 22:17—23:14 has verses that have close affinities to passages in other sections. If Proverbs seems to collect sayings scattered in _Amenemope_, some scattered passages in Proverbs seem to be collected in _Amenemope_. Thus the arguments pro and con seem about evenly balanced. A mediating position—that the Egyptian work and Proverbs both used a common ANE oral tradition or perhaps even a common Vorlage—is a possibility. Father Murphy’s view that the Hebrew passage may simply be using the Egyptian “thirty chapters” as a model rather than a direct source also merits consideration. R. B. Y. Scott expresses a similar view.[](https://biblicalscholarship.wordpress.com/2022/07/01/book-of-proverbs-authorship/#fn-5404-zeb-35838 "Read footnote.")
```

To summarize, there are literary and thematic differences between the book of Proverbs and Amenemope. When looking at both texts in their entirety, the similarities are minor and certainly not the only connection which can be drawn from the many writings during that time period. There is also a major contradiction between the texts when looking from a theological perspective, monotheism contrasted with polytheism. To say then, that Proverbs plagiarizes from Amenemope is a stretch, because there are some similarities between some of the 'wisdoms'. Also taking into consideration that Solomon could have been a compiler of different works is another proof against the contention that Proverbs is based largely on Amenemope.

To address the claim:

```markdown
Er zijn dusdanig veel overeenkomsten tussen deze tekst en het bijbelboek spreuken dat wetenschappers aannemen dat het bijbelboek spreuken enorm veel inspiratie heeft genomen van deze oude egyptische tekst
```

Since there are many sources the author(s) of Proverbs could have used in the compilation, to say that the Book of Proverbs is "largely inspired" by Amenemope is a big stretch. The only real overlap that can be found is in Proverbs 22:17-24:22.

---
## The issue in Proverbs 22:20 addressed

It is important to look at the Septuagint since these were the texts in the hands of the Early Church Fathers who canonized the Bible.

### Codex Vaticanus

The Septuagint renders the verse as follows[^5]:

![[Vat.gr.1209_0742_pa_0738_m.jpg]]

> καὶ σὺ δὲ ἀπόγραψαι αὐτὰ σεαυτῷ **τρισσῶς** εἰς βουλὴν καὶ γνῶσιν ἐπὶ τὸ πλάτος τῆς καρδίας σου.
> 
> [ΠΑΡΟΙΜΙΑΙ ΣΟΛΟΜΩΝΤΟΣ 22:20](https://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/septuagint/chapter.asp?book=26)

Translation from the Greek by GPT:

> “And you also write them down for yourself **three times**,  
> for counsel and knowledge,  
> upon the breadth of your heart.”

Translation OSB (based on the LXX):

> And register them upon the breadth of your heart for yourself **threefold**, for counsel and knowledge.
> 
> Proverbs 22:23

### Codex Sinaiticus

![[Pasted image 20260214200838.png]]

Here[^6] also the Greek uses that same word τριϲϲωϲ.

### The meaning of τριϲϲωϲ

The meaning of τρισσός or τριϲϲωϲ or τρισσῶς is threefold[^7].

### The interpretation of the Early Church

> In the Proverbs of Solomon we find some such rule as the following laid down, respecting the consideration of [holy](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm) Scripture: And do, he says, de­scribe these things to yourself in a threefold manner, in counsel and [knowledge](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm), and that you may an­swer the words of [truth](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15073a.htm) to those who have proposed them to you. Each one, then, ought to describe in his own [mind](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm), in a **threefold manner**, the under­standing of the divine letters — that is, in order that all the more simple individuals may be edified, so to speak, by the very body of Scripture; for such we term that common and historical sense: while, if some have commenced to make considerable prog­ress, and are able to see something more (than that), _they_ may be edified by the very [soul](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm) of Scripture.
> 
> Origen, De Principiis, Book IV.11

Origen here understands the correct wording of the verse and interprets it through his framework.

### Answer to the claim

So to answer the claim:

```markdown
Dit zijn allemaal vertalingen die compleet andere woorden gebruiken voor het woord wat er in het hebreeuws echt stond. namelijk het woord שָׁלִישִׁ֑ים (šā·lî·šîm) wat gewoon letterlijk ‘30’ betekent. In de septuagint wordt het vertaald met τρισσῶς (drievoud) in de kjv met excellent things en in de herziene statenvertaling met heerlijke dingen. Dit zijn allemaal ruime interpretaties die verschillen van elkaar en dat komt omdat tot honderd jaar geleden niemand echt wist wat het woord ‘30’ in deze zin deed en daarom werd het dus heel vrij geïnterpreteerd. 
```

Even though current translators have not understood the verse and why the word τρισσός is there, the early Christians, before their time, have seen, read, and interpreted the verse with no contention or ambiguity about the wording. Which means there was no confusion and the translation was not 'freely interpreted', the correct translation was used for the word τρισσός and with the word, the early fathers were able to interpret the verse and explain it.
 
### Commentaries from recent translators

Pulpit commentary:

> Verse 20. - Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge? There is a difficulty about the word tendered "excellent things." The Khetib has שׁלשׁום, "the day before yesterday, formerly;" but the word occurs nowhere alone, and, as Nowack says, can hardly have been the original reading. However, Ewald, Bertheau, and others, adopting it, suppose that the author refers to some earlier work. Cheyne cites Bickell's rendering, "Now, years before now, have I written unto thee long before with counsels and knowledge," and considers the words to mean either that the compiler took a long time over his work, or that this was not the first occasion of his writing. One does not see why stress should be here laid on former instruction, unless, perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, in contrast to "this day" of the previous verse. The LXX. renders the word τρισσῶς thus, "And do thou record them for thyself triply for counsel and knowledge upon the table of thine heart." St. Jerome has, Ecce descripsi eam tibi tripliciter, in cogitationibus et scientiis. Other versions have also given a numerical explanation to the term. In it is seen an allusion to the three supposed works of Solomon - Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles - which is absurd; others refer it to the threefold division of the Testament - Law, Prophets, and Hagiographa; others, to three classes of youths for whom the admonitious were intended; others, again, think it equivalent to "oftentimes," or "in many forms." But the reading is as doubtful as the explanations of it are unsatisfactory. The genuine word is doubtless preserved in the Keri, which gives שָׁלִשִׁים (shalishim), properly a military term, applied to chariot fighters and men of rank in the army. The LXX. translates the word by τριστὰτης e.g. [Exodus 14:7](https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm); [Exodus 15:4](https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm)), which is equivalent to "chieftain." Hence the Hebrew term, understood in the neuter gender, is transferred to the chief among proverbs - "choice proverbs," as Delitzsch calls them. The Venetian, by a happy turn, gives τρισμέγιστα. Thus we come back to the rendering of the Authorized Version as meet correct and intelligible.

Study bible:

> **thirty sayings**  
> The reference to "thirty sayings" may allude to a structured collection of wisdom, similar to other ancient Near Eastern wisdom literature, such as the Egyptian "Instruction of Amenemope," which also contains thirty chapters. This connection highlights the shared cultural practice of compiling wisdom teachings in a systematic way. The number thirty could symbolize completeness or a comprehensive set of teachings.

## How is The Book of Proverbs 'inspired by God' if it is a collection of other sources of wisdom from the ancient times?

The quoted contention:

```markdown
IMPLICATIE: De verwevenheid van oude egyptische wijsheidsteksten en bijbelboeken suggereert dat de tekst via gewone menselijke literatuur processen tot stand is gekomen en niet via een persoon direct geïnspireerd is door een bovenmenselijk wezen.

Alhoewel het vereren van katten en dergelijke zaken niet is overgenomen in bijbelboeken gelukkig haha
```

To answer the argument we can define what God-inspired means by highlighting some criteria the Fathers have set:

> We should leave things of that nature to [God](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm) who created us, being most properly assured that **the [Scriptures](https://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html) are indeed perfect, since they were spoken by the \[Word of God](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm) and His Spirit**; but we, inasmuch as we are inferior to, and later in [existence](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05543b.htm) than, the [Word of God](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09328a.htm) and His Spirit, are on that very account destitute of the [knowledge](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm) of His [mysteries](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10662a.htm).
> 
> St. Irenaeus of Lyons, Against Heresies, Book II, Chapter 28.2

> These are fountains of [salvation](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13407a.htm), that they **who thirst may be satisfied with the living words they contain. In these alone is proclaimed the doctrine of godliness**. Let no man add to these, neither let him take ought from these.
> 
> St. Athanasius of Alexandria, Letter 39.6

> We, however, in conformity with our belief in that doctrine, which we assuredly hold to be divinely inspired, [believe](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02408b.htm) that **it is possible in no other way to explain and bring within the reach of [human](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm) [knowledge](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm) this higher and diviner reason** as the [Son of God](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14142b.htm), than by means of those Scriptures alone which were inspired by the [Holy Spirit](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm), i.e., the [Gospels](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06655b.htm) and Epistles, and the law and the [prophets](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm), according to the declaration of Christ Himself.

> 
> St. John Chrysostom, Homilies on II Timothy, Homily 9

So taking into consideration these facts about Scripture we can examine how Proverbs is God-inspired in light of Amenemope. 

First we would say that Proverbs is wisdom literature, so to follow it is to find truth and wisdom. Since Proverbs is in truth and not in error like the pagan text of Amenemope, we can say that the former is God-inspired and the latter is not. 
Second, since we understand that all wisdom is from God, and many people can reach a certain (sometimes high) form of wisdom, it will never be the fullness of wisdom. 

Now, where in this case the inspiration of God is acting we can see by comparing the texts. We know that one is polytheistic and the other not, we also see that much more true wisdom is found in Proverbs than in Amenemope. This point obviously rests on what epistemology one uses, but this is a debate for another time.

We can observe this effect of wisdom being found in other places like the Greek philosophers. Here are what the interpretations of the Fathers are:

> We have been taught that [Christ](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm) is the [first-born](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06081a.htm) of [God](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm), and we have declared above that He is the Word of whom every race of men were partakers; **and those who lived reasonably are [Christians](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03712a.htm), even though they have been thought [atheists](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02040a.htm); as, among the Greeks, Socrates and Heraclitus, and men like them; and among the barbarians, [Abraham](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01051a.htm), and Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael, and Elias, and many others whose actions and names we now decline to recount, because we [know](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm) it would be tedious**. So that even they who lived before Christ, and lived without reason, were [wicked](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm) and hostile to [Christ](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm), and slew those who lived reasonably. But who, through the power of the Word, according to the [will](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15624a.htm) of [God](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608a.htm) the Father and Lord of all, He was born of a [virgin](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15458a.htm) as a [man](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm), and was named Jesus, and was crucified, and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, an intelligent man will be able to comprehend from what has been already so largely said. And we, since the [proof](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm) of this subject is less needful now, will pass for the present to the [proof](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12454c.htm) of those things which are urgent.

Perchance, too, [philosophy](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12025c.htm) was given to the Greeks directly and primarily, till the Lord should call the Greeks. For this was a schoolmaster to bring "the Hellenic [mind](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm)", as the law, the Hebrews, "to [Christ](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm)".

For he says that it becomes us to philosophize with strength, and dignity, and wisdom — holding unalterably the same opinions about the same things, with reference to the dignity of heaven. Accordingly, therefore, he interprets what is in the law, enjoining us to look to one God and to do [justly](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm). Of politics, he says there are two kinds — the department of law, and that of politics, strictly so called.

That department of politics which is called "Law", he divides into administrative magnanimity and private good order, which he calls orderliness; and harmony, and sobriety, which are seen when rulers suit their subjects, and subjects are [obedient](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11181c.htm) to their rulers; a result which the system of [Moses](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10596a.htm) sedulously aims at effecting.

Then, in my opinion, the end both of the statesman, and of him who lives according to the law, is [contemplation](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04324b.htm). It is necessary, therefore, that public affairs should be rightly managed. But to philosophize is best.

Here we can see that they certainly agree with a lot and acknowledged the wisdom some found, but only the Scriptures do they hold as God-inspired.

This same concept can be applied to the ancient Egyptians and their wisdom literature.
### Conclusion

So to say that Proverbs is not God-inspired because it contains wisdom which others have attained as well, is a false argument. So again the argument:

```
IMPLICATIE: De verwevenheid van oude egyptische wijsheidsteksten en bijbelboeken suggereert dat de tekst via gewone menselijke literatuur processen tot stand is gekomen en niet via een persoon direct geïnspireerd is door een bovenmenselijk wezen. Ook is het opmerkelijk dat een bijbelboek inspiratie neemt uit literatuur van de egyptenaren, die polytheistisch waren en katten vereerden onder andere. Alhoewel het vereren van katten en dergelijke zaken niet is overgenomen in bijbelboeken gelukkig haha
```

We do not believe Proverbs has come about through purely human means, even though it contains some human elements. And even though the Egyptians were pagans, we cannot judge if all were mistaken, or if some were on the right path just as some of the Greek philosophers. Especially considering the fact that the writers of Amenemope were working toward true wisdom, which is the goal of people who write such literature.

## Summary

Now that it is established that only a small part of Proverbs has similarities with Amenemope here a few points:

First of all, all wisdom comes from God[^8]. 

Second, since Proverbs was compiled and there was a lot of literature present at the time, Solomon could have compiled the wisdom of God which could still be present in other peoples, since God has Providence over all[^9]. And it could also be the case that they happen to stumble upon the same wisdom, which is possible, but less likely when examining the similarities between the relevant parts. 

Third, a very important point to keep in mind is that the Proverbs explicitly teaches one true God, even the Divine Name YHWH, and does not adopt any of the polytheistic ideologies; this is a big piece of evidence, showing that there was no baseless copying done, but that these compilations were thoroughly scrutinized before accepting it as wisdom. Thoughts which humans, even though polytheists, had developed can still be considered wisdom, but to discern we need a prophet to verify. 

Fourthly, why Amenemope was never called a holy book of God, or God-inspired is clear from the polytheistic framework[^1] that it is written in. For something to be inspired by God, it has to uphold a high standard which Amenemope does not. Since this is the case we cannot ever call it God inspired, but we can recognize the wisdom of God which can be present anywhere. 

We must not forget that God reaches out to us[^10] and loves us[^11], we are indeed made in His image[^12]. With this in mind, it is not strange that people who try to find wisdom and truth, will always grow close to God who is the Truth[^13]. This is also present in the Greek philosophers, who came close to our current understanding of God[^14]. And even though we do not call their works God inspired, our holy fathers built upon their philosophical foundation to explain many things about the nature of reality and truth. 

It is dishonest to say that if a text has mistakes, it is fully wrong (just like a student passes a course without having a 100% mark on the exam), we recognize truth in many place, but not all works do we call God inspired.

In this case we can say that the wisdom God gave to Solomon is discernment of truth and most likely other reasons which we cannot comprehend yet.

### Granting the argument + polemic

Even if some of the books were very much inspired by other peoples, if they contain truth, then this is not a problem to use. But the question is, do you think Christ preached the truth? If so, then we can trust Him. 

The Gospels were not inspired by any other text, they were testimonies of the events which occurred during Jesus' ministry. So with this in mind, now reading the words of Christ, we believe in Him, we trust Him, and we accept His Church and her decisions.

And if no text at all can be trusted, then we get to atheism, which is one of the many dangerous paths leading to our own destruction.

## Discussion

If there is still disagreement about the similarity between Proverbs and Amenemope, we can get the manuscripts and read. Nice project to examine the texts using the original and most ancient physical sources.
