# Against the Saracens
## N — The fourteenth error of the Saracens.

Who do not have the old fasts of the Jews, nor the new \[fasts of the]
Christians.
	We shall see, first, the differences between foods: Which are for
fasting, and which are for feasting? We say that all \[edible] objects
are divided into two kinds: those with breath and those without
breath. That is, the living and the lifeless. Now, those that breathe,
such as sheep, or those that come forth from that which breathes,
such as milk and eggs, are edible and are food for feasting. And those
that are without breath, such as plants and fruits, are food for fasting.
But you do not have this differentiation; then, therefore, you do not
have fasting.
	First, Moses fasted for forty days and forty nights without eating
anything. Similarly, Christ fasted without food for forty days and
forty nights. And in our times Christians keep a fast for fifty days
and are content with food \[permissible] for abstinence. But your
fasting is not similar, since it is for thirty days, less than the old and
new fasts. Also, the food \[consumed] is provision both for feasting
and joyous occasions. Then, therefore, it is apparent that you do not
have fasting.
	And if they say, we do not eat until evening, we say that there
are two options for fasting: One concerns time, \[and] the other
concerns food. When we, Christian people, remain hungry until
evening and at evening we are satisfied with Lenten food, you
\[remain hungry] as far as time goes, but you overlook the food \[you
eat]; then, therefore, you do not have fasting.
	Again, during the whole year you eat during the day, and not at
night. But during the month of Ramadan, you eat at night, and not
during the day. Evidently, as you do not keep \[fasting] in other
months, likewise that month \[Ramadan] is not a time for fasting.
	Again, your fasting is not thirty days, but one day, because
though you fast during the day, you break it in the evening and feast,
and again on the following day you fast.
	Again, daytime and night make one \[twenty-four-hour] day, as
Moses says: “And there was evening and there was morning, one
day” (Gen 1:5). Now, you fast during daytime and break \[the fast] at
night; obviously, your fasting is half a day, and not a whole \[day].
	Again, for God there is no daytime or night in the heavens, but
always daytime. But for us the movement of the sun from one point
to another marks a day. And so long as the sun has not completed its
cycle, it makes no difference whether the breaking \[of the fast] occurs
during the daytime or at night.
	Again, you fast during daytime and break \[the fast] at night, as if
God sees during daytime and does not at night; otherwise, why do
you not fast at night?
	So much concerning this.
