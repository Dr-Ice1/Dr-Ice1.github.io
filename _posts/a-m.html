    <p>There is a lot of controversy surrounding this topic<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>, so let's look at what the sources have to say.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Narrated `Aisha: that the Prophet () married her when she was <strong>six years</strong> old and he <strong>consummated</strong> his marriage <strong>when she was nine years old</strong>, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).<br>
      <em>Sahih al-Bukhari 5133</em><br>
      <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5133">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5133</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Narrated Aisha: The Prophet (ﷺ) engaged me when <strong>I was a girl of six (years)</strong>. We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while <strong>I was playing in a swing</strong> with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Allright, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, "Best wishes and Allah's Blessing and a good luck." Then she entrusted me to them and <strong>they prepared me (for the marriage)</strong>. Unexpectedly Allah's Apostle came to me in the forenoon and <strong>my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.</strong><br>
      <em>Sahih al-Bukhari 3894 — Chapter 44: Marriage of the Prophet (saws) with ‘Aishah رضي الله عنها, Book 63: Merits of the Helpers in Madinah (Ansaar)</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Clearly, we can see the most trusted Islamic source (in this case Aisha herself) reporting the age of Aisha being 6 years old when she was married off to Mohammed and 9 years old when he consumated the marriage. However, many Muslims will try to justify this event. We will look at each of these arguments and refute them.</p>

    <p>Here are the most common arguments made:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aisha was mature and not a child.</li>
      <li>It was culturally accepted at that time.</li>
      <li>The Quran says one has to start the age of puberty to marry.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While these are only some of the arguments, they are the ones I personally heard many times. So now, let us address these points.</p>

    <h2 id="refutation">Refutation</h2>

    <h3 id="aisha-was-mature-and-not-a-child">Aisha was mature and not a child.</h3>
    <p>This claim is usually made with the assumption that during that time period in that culture, the starting age was counted from puberty and not from birth. This assumption suggests that Aisha may have been considered mature and at an age deemed acceptable for marriage even by present-day social standards. However, this is not the case when we look at Islamic laws and examine the sources. By law, dolls and puppets are forbidden from the people since they are seen as idols, and idolatry is considered a grave sin. Only when a child has not started puberty are dolls permissible and seen as children's toys.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> We can read about this in the Sahih sources:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (<strong>The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.</strong>) (Fath-ul-Bari page 143, Vol.13)<br>
      <em>Sahih al-Bukhari 6130 — Chapter 81: To be cheerful with the people, Book 78: Good Manners and Form (Al-Adab)</em><br>
      <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Now we know who can play with dolls, we look at what the sources say about Aisha, in Sahih Muslim and Sunan an-Nasa'i we read:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (ﷺ) married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, <strong>and her dolls were with her</strong>; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old.<br>
      <em>Sahih Muslim 1422c — Chapter 10: It is permissible for a father to arrange the marriage of a young virgin, Book 16: The Book of Marriage</em><br>
      <a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1422c">https://sunnah.com/muslim:1422c</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It was narrated that 'Aishah said: "The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, <strong>and I used to play with dolls</strong>."<br>
      <em>Sunan an-Nasa'i 3378 — Chapter 78: Consummation Of Marriage With A Girl Of Nine, Book 26: The Book of Marriage — Grade: Sahih (Darussalam)</em><br>
      <a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378">https://sunnah.com/nasai:3378</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We clearly read how Aisha used to play with dolls and have them with her, meaning she could only be <strong>before the age of puberty when the marriage was consumated</strong>.</p>
    <p>Secondly, even if we were to look at the start of puberty as an indication one can marry, this is still immoral, pedophilia, and child abuse. Since physical indications of puberty can be seen very early on, and there have even been cases where young children give birth.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> These cases are proof that the start of puberty is no absolute indication for maturity and readiness for marriage.</p>

    <h3 id="it-was-culturally-accepted-at-that-time">It was culturally accepted at that time.</h3>
    <p>Even though this is obviously no justification, especially since we now have the scientific knowledge to see the harm child marriage causes, Muslims will try to reconcile a supposed perfect example for mankind to follow, with this day and age.</p>
    <p>This clearly shows he is not a perfect example for mankind to follow and demonstrates that he was a product of a corrupt culture.</p>

    <h3 id="the-quran-says-one-has-to-start-the-age-of-puberty-to-marry">The Quran says one has to start the age of puberty to marry.</h3>
    <p>This claim is usually in reference to <a href="https://quranx.com/4.6">Quran 4:6</a> which only addresses orphans. But when we look at <a href="https://quranx.com/65.4">Quran 65:4</a> which is a Surah about divorce, we read something contradictory to this claim. The verse talks about the waiting period after marriage for three categories of women: 1) those who are too old to menstruate, 2) those who have not menstruated, and 3) those who are pregnant. There is a lot of debate surrounding the meaning of this verse. But for highly regarded Islamic scholars from centuries ago, there was consensus on the meaning of this verse. In another article we will look at the verse, examine it, and look at the interpretation of the scholars.</p>
