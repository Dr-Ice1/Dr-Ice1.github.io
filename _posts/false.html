    <h2 id="summary-of-the-tiktok-clip">Summary of the tiktok clip</h2>
    <p>
      The person in the tiktok clip tackles the argument, that muslims who can't read Arabic pose which is, that the word in the Quran and the hadith are different.
      He mentions an analogy to show why this reasoning is false. He says, if for example Allah says that Muhammad would break his leg, in the Quran, if he were a false prophet;
      and in the hadith it said that Muhammad broke his tibia, this would not contradict because the tibia is the largest bone in the leg meaning the leg is still broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, in the Quran it says that the “life artery” of Muhammad will be cut if he were a false prophet.
      Which does not refer to a specific artery in the body but is interpreted as the aorta. In the hadith however, it says specifically aorta.
      In this case the analogy given still applies, however, since the life artery is mainly known as the aorta this is an even stronger case which is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the word used in the hadith:
      <a href="https://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A/">https://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A/</a>
      and here is the word used in the Quran:
      <a href="https://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86/">https://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86/</a>

    <h2 id="the-relevant-text">The relevant text</h2>

    <p>Quran: <a href="https://quran.com/69/40-50" target="_blank" rel="noopener">69:40-50</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Narrated `Aisha: The Prophet (ﷺ) in his ailment in which he died, used to say, "O <code>`Aisha</code>! I still
      feel the pain caused by the food I ate at Khaibar, and at this time, <strong>I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison</strong>."</p>
      <p><em>Sahih al-Bukhari 4428</em><br>
      Chapter 83: The sickness of the Prophet (saws) and his death, Book 64.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Hadith:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Narrated Abu Hurairah:<br>
      The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) would accept a present, but would not accept alms (sadaqah). And Wahb bin Baqiyyah narrated to us, elsewhere, from Khalid, from Muhammad ibn Amr said on the authority of AbuSalamah, and he did not mention the name of Abu Hurairah: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to accept presents but not alms (sadaqah).<br><br>
      This version adds: So a Jewess presented him at Khaybar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ate of it and the people also ate.<br>
      He then said: Take away your hands (from the food), for it has informed me that it is poisoned. Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died.<br>
      So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): What motivated you to do the work you have done?<br>
      She said: If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I should rid the people of you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then ordered regarding her and she was killed.<br>
      He then said about the pain of which he died: I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaybar. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.</p>

      <p><em>Sunan Abi Dawud 4512</em><br>
      Chapter 1649: If A Person Gives A Man Poison To Drink Or Eat, And He Dies, Is He Subject To Retaliation ?, Book 41: Types of Blood-Wit (Kitab Al-Diyat)<br>
      Grade: Hasan Sahih (Al-Albani)<br>
      <a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4512">https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4512</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The draw conclusion from the prooftext and the word analysis is that the argument holds and shows how Muhammad is a false prophet according to the Quran spoken by Allah.
