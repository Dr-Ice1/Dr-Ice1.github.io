## Summary of the tiktok clip

The person in the tiktok clip tackles the argument, that muslims who can't read Arabic pose which is, that the word in the Quran and the hadith are different. He mentions an analogy to show why this reasoning is false. He says, if for example Allah says that Muhammad would break his leg, in the Quran, if he were a false prophet; and in the hadith it said that Muhammad broke his tibia, this would not contradict because the tibia is the largest bone in the leg meaning the leg is still broken. Similarly, in the Quran it says that the 'life artery' of Muhammad will be cut if he were a false prophet. Which does not refer to a specific artery in the body but is interpreted as the aorta. In the hadith however, it says specifically aorta. In this case the analogy given still applies, however, since the life artery is mainly known as the aorta this is an even stronger case which is made. Here is the word used in the hadith: https://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A/ and here is the word used in the Quran: https://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86/

>He then said: Take away your hands (from the food), for it has informed me that it is poisoned. Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died.
>So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): What motivated you to do the work you have done?
>She said: If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I should rid the people of you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then ordered regarding her and she was killed. He then said about the pain of which he died: I continued to feel pain from the morsel which I had eaten at Khaybar. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.
