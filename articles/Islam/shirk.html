    <p>
      P1. Swearing by anything other than Allah is shirk.<br>
      P2. Allah swears by everything.<br><br>
      C. Allah commits shirk.
    </p>

    <h2 id="the-worst-possible-sin-in-islam">The worst possible sin in Islam</h2>
    <p>According to the Quran, the worst possible sin in Islam is shirk:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Surely Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him, and forgives what is besides that to whomsoever He pleases; and whoever associates anything with Allah, he devises indeed a great sin. S. 4:48</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Surely Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him, and He forgives what is besides this to whom He pleases; and whoever associates anything with Allah, he indeed strays off into a remote error. S. 4:116</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>So shirk is unforgivable by Allah, even though he might forgive other sins.</p>

    <h3 id="muhammad-told-his-followers-not-to-swear-on-anything-but-allah">Muhammad told his followers not to swear on anything but Allah</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Narrated Ibn `Umar: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "If anybody has to take an oath, he should swear only by Allah." The people of Quraish used to swear by their fathers, but the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Do not swear by your fathers."</p>
      <p><em>Sahih al-Bukhari 3836</em><br>
      <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3836">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3836</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>'Abdullah (b. Umar) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) found, Umar b. al-Khattab amongst the riders and he was taking oath by his father Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called them (saying) ; Our Allah, the Exated and Majestic, has forbidden you that you take oath by your father. He who bag to take an oath, he must take it by Allah or keep quiet.</p>
      <p><em>Sahih Muslim 1646d</em><br>
      <a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1646d">https://sunnah.com/muslim:1646d</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Abd al-Rahman b. Samura reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Do not swear by idols, nor by your fathers.</p>
      <p><em>Sahih Muslim 1648</em><br>
      <a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1648">https://sunnah.com/muslim:1648</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Narrated AbuHurayrah:<br>
      The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Do not swear by your fathers, or by your mothers, or by rivals to Allah; and swear by Allah only, and swear by Allah only when you are speaking the truth.</p>
      <p><em>Sunan Abi Dawud 3248</em><br>
      Grade: Sahih (Al-Albani)<br>
      <a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3248">https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3248</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Narrated Ibn `Umar: that he found `Umar bin Al-Khattab in a group of people and he was swearing by his father. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called them, saying, "Verily! Allah forbids you to swear by your fathers. If one has to take an oath, he should swear by Allah or otherwise keep quiet."</p>
      <p><em>Sahih al-Bukhari 6108</em><br>
      <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6108">https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6108</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3 id="why-did-muhammad-tell-his-followers-not-to-swear-on-anything-but-allah">Why did Muhammad tell his followers not to swear on anything but Allah?</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Sa'id ibn Ubaydah said: Ibn Umar heard a man swearing: No, I swear by the Ka'bah. Ibn Umar said to him: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: <strong>He who swears by anyone but Allah is polytheist.</strong></p>
      <p><em>Sunan Abi Dawud 3251</em><br>
      Grade: Sahih (Al-Albani)<br>
      <a href="https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3251">https://sunnah.com/abudawud:3251</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Now sunnah.com does not translate correctly in this case, since the word used means “committing an act of shirk”, not “is a polytheist”. As the Islamic meaning is shown on this website:
      <a href="https://www.almaany.com/en/dict/ar-en/%D8%A3%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83/">almaany.com entry</a>
    </p>

    <p>So we can see that swearing on something other than Allah is committing shirk.</p>

    <h2 id="what-does-allah-swear-by">What does Allah swear by?</h2>

    <blockquote><p>I swear by the Quran full of wisdom S. 36:2</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>Suad, I swear by the Quran, full of admonition. S. 38:1</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>I swear by the Book that makes things clear: S. 43:2</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>Qaf. I swear by the glorious Quran (that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah) S. 50:1</p></blockquote>

    <p>So we conclude from these verses that the Quran is Allahs partner. Consistent with the claim Muslims make that the Quran is eternal and shares this attribute with Allah.</p>

    <blockquote><p>Verily, by thy life (O Prophet), in their wild intoxication, they wander in distraction, to and fro. S. 15:72 Yusuf Ali</p></blockquote>

    <p>Again we conclude Muhammad is a partner of Allah. And again consistent since Muslims don't treat Muhammad like a mere human or even a prophet, but elevate him high.</p>

    <blockquote><p>Then I swear by the angels who bring down the revelation, S. 77:5</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>I swear by the angels who violently pull out the souls of the wicked, S. 79:1</p></blockquote>

    <p>Allah swears by his angles making them his partners.</p>

    <blockquote><p>But nay! I swear by the stars, S. 81:15</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>I swear by the mansions of the stars, S. 85:1</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>But nay! I swear by the falling of stars; S. 56:75</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>I swear by the sun and its brilliance, S. 91:1</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>Nay; I swear by the moon, S. 74:32</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>I swear by the daybreak, S. 89:1</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>But nay! I swear by the sunset redness, S. 84:16</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>I swear by the night when it draws a veil, S. 92:1</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>I swear by the raingiving heavens, S. 86:11</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>I swear by the wind that scatters far and wide, S. 51:1</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>Nay! I swear by this city. S. 90:1</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>Noon. I swear by the pen and what the angels write, S. 68:1</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>I swear by the Mountain, S. 52:1</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>I swear by the fig and the olive, And mount Sinai, And this city made secure, S. 95:1-3</p></blockquote>

    <p>These are a lot of partners, no? There is more:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>But nay! I swear by that which you see, And that which you do not see. S. 69:38-39</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>So Allah swears by everything visible AND invisible, meaning everything is a partner of Allah. This makes Islam the religion with the most gods and pure polytheism.</p>
