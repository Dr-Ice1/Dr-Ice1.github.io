<p>In the Old Testament we can find an interesting subject, who is the angel of the Lord. The definite article shows that this is a specific angel since other angels are either &#8220;an angel of the Lord&#8221; or &#8220;an angel&#8221;. Let us look at some of the verses to see where we can find the angel of the Lord mentioned.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> And he said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then <strong>the angel of the Lord told her</strong>, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her.” <sup><strong>10</strong></sup><strong> The angel added, “I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.” </strong><sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The angel of the Lord also said to her: “You are now pregnant and you will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the Lord has heard of your misery. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.” <sup><strong>13</strong></sup><strong> She gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,”</strong> for she said, “I have now seen the One who sees me.” <strong>Genesis 16:7-13</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%2016%3A7-13&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-10.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/Genesis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Here we clearly see that the angel of the Lord HIMSELF is saying that HE will increase her descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count, this is in and of itself a divine action. Also it is a parallel with the promise God made with Abraham (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2015%3A5&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Genesis 15:5</strong></a>). Furthermore Hagar spoke and we read that she gave the name to the Lord who spoke to her, who is the angel, &#8220;the God who sees me&#8221;. Again this is clear evidence of the divinity of the angel of the Lord.</p>



<p>Hagar is not the only person who has interacted with the angel of the Lord and left the reader wondering if this angel is God Himself. We read further.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>10</strong></sup> “In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup><strong> The angel of God</strong> said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob.’ I answered, ‘Here I am.’ <sup><strong>12</strong></sup><strong> And he said</strong>, ‘Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup><strong> I am the God of Bethel</strong>, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.’” <strong>Genesis 31:10-13</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2031%3A10-13&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/genesis/31-13.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/Genesis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Here the angel of the Lord calls HIMSELF the God of Bethel, referencing <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2028%3A10-22&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Genesis 28:10-22</strong></a>. Another time the angel appears.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So Jacob was left alone, and <strong>a man</strong> wrestled with him till daybreak. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When <strong>the man</strong> saw that he could not overpower him, <strong>he touched</strong> the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with <strong>the man</strong>. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup><strong> Then the man said, “Let me go</strong>, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “<strong>I will not let you go unless you bless me.</strong>” <sup><strong>27</strong></sup><strong> The man</strong> asked him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he answered. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup><strong> Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.”</strong><sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” <strong>Then he blessed him there.</strong><sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, <strong>“It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.” Genesis 32:24-30</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2032%3A24-30&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/genesis/32-30.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/Genesis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>We can find more detail on who this God, who Jacob saw face to face, is precisely. So we get more information from Hosea.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The Lord has a charge to bring against Judah; he will punish <strong>Jacob</strong> according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel; <strong>as a man he struggled with God.</strong><sup><strong>4</strong></sup><strong> He struggled with <span style="text-decoration: underline">the angel</span> and overcame him; he wept and begged for his favor. He found him at Bethel and talked with him there— <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> the Lord God Almighty, the Lord is his name! Hosea 12:2-5</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%2012%3A2-5&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/hosea/12-2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/Osse.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The God with whom Jacob struggled is called &#8220;the angel&#8221; by Hosea. Another passage we shall examine affirms the deity of the Angel:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>20</strong></sup> “<strong>See, I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared</strong>. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. <strong>Do not rebel against him; he will not forgive your rebellion, since <u>my Name is in him</u>.</strong><sup><strong>22</strong></sup> If you listen carefully to what he says and do all that I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> My angel will go ahead of you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out. <strong>Exodus 23:20-23</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus%2023%3A20-23&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/exodus/23-20.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/Exod.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So we read the Angel has (1) The power to destroy the enemies of Israel. (2) Forgive sins. (3) Goes ahead of Israel. We can cross reference this with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus%2013%3A21-22&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Exodus 13:21-22</strong></a> where God goes ahead of Israel.</p>



<p>Now we have many more OT verses (<strong>Gen. 16:9-13, 18:2, 21:7, 22:11, 31:11, 33:11-13; Ex. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%203%3A1-20&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3:1-20</a>, 14:19, 23:21, 32:34; Jos. 5:13-15; Jud. 2:1, 4, 5:23, 6:11ff., 13:3ff.; Is. 63:9; Ps. 34:8</strong>), but because we can not go over all of them in this article we will look at two more:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the Lord, he exclaimed, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! <span style="text-decoration: underline">I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face!</span>” <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But <span style="text-decoration: underline">the Lord said to him</span>, “Peace! Do not be afraid. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">You are not going to die</span></strong>.” <strong>Judges 6:22-23</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=judges%206%3A22-23&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/apostolic/judges/6.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong> GRK</a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/judges/6-22.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong> HEB</a>)(<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/2329/JDG.6.%25D5%2586%25D5%258E%25D4%25B1%25D4%25B1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Clearly Gideon sees the angel of the Lord and the angel (&#8220;the Lord&#8221;) assures Him, He will not die.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When the angel of the Lord did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife, <strong><u>Manoah realized that it was the angel of the Lord. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> “We are doomed to die!” he said to his wife. “We have seen God!</u>” Judges 13:21-22</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=judges%2013%3A21-22&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/apostolic/judges/13.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong> GRK</a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/judges/13-22.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong> HEB</a>)(<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/2329/JDG.13.%25D5%2586%25D5%258E%25D4%25B1%25D4%25B1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So Manoah realized that he saw the angel of the Lord and thinks he will die, for he thinks they have seen GOD.</p>



<p>Another intersting passage where we read of the Angel of the Lord is in the Psalms:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><span style="text-decoration: underline">The angel of the Lord</span> encamps all around those who <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">fear Him</span></strong>, And <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">delivers</span></strong> them. <strong>Psalm 34:7</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2034%3A7&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/psalms/34-7.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/2329/PSA.34.7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This passage is interesting because it combines (1) fearing the Angel of the Lord, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206%3A13&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Deuteronomy 6:13</strong></a>, and (2) The Angel will deliver them, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2013%3A21&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Ezekiel 13:21</strong></a>, God delivers.</p>



<p>We can see from these passages that the Angel of the Lord is divine, this already causes a problem for unitarian heretics, oneness, and anyone who believen God is only one person. Now we will examine the divinity of the Son of Man. In the New Testament we read that Christ calls Himself the Son of Man many times, but what does this mean. In the Old Testament we read prophecies that show who this Son of Man is:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>13</strong></sup> “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a <strong>son of man, <u>coming with the clouds of heaven</u></strong>. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. <strong>Daniel 7:13-14</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%207%3A13-14&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/daniel/7-13.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/Daniel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗ 8:13-14</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Here is the what we read in the article<sup><strong><a href="https://answeringislamblog.wordpress.com/2024/10/04/daniels-son-of-man-yhwhs-angel-pt-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1</a></strong></sup>: &#8220;What makes the one like the Son of Man figure so astonishing is that he rides the clouds like God does (cf. <strong>Exodus 13:21-22; 14:24-26; 33:7-11; 40:34-38; Num. 10:34; 12:4-5; Deut. 33:26; Pss. 68:4, 33-34; 104:1-2; Isa. 19:1; Nahum 1:3</strong>), receives the same worship that God receives from all nations, peoples and languages (cf. <strong>7:27; 3:12, 14, 17-18, 28; 6:16, 20, 22</strong>), and rules for the same duration that God does (cf. <strong>6:26; Lam. 5:21-22</strong>). Clearly, this is no created being!&#8221;</p>



<p>Christ claims to be THIS Son of Man in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2026%3A64-65&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Matthew 26:64-65</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%2014%3A60-64&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mark 14:60-64</strong></a> and there is no mistaking it since we can read the reaction of the high priest and others.</p>



<p>Now that we have seen the divinity of the Angel of the Lord and why Christ calls Himself the Son of Man, we will look at the uniqueness of the Son of God. In the Old Testament we read many who are called sons of God (excerpt from source<sup><strong><a href="https://answeringislamblog.wordpress.com/2020/02/27/jesus-as-the-son-of-god-a-biblical-exegesis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2</a></strong></sup>):</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The title is used in relation to angelic beings who dwell in the presence of God and are his personal messengers. (Cf. <strong>Genesis 6:2-4; Job 1:6, 2:1, 38:7; Psalm 89:6</strong>)</li>



<li>Those who have come into covenant relation with God such as:
<ol class="wp-block-list">

<li>Israel – (Cf. <strong>Exodus 4:22; Jeremiah 31:9; Hosea 11:1</strong>)</li>



<li>King David – (Cf. <strong>Psalm 2:7; 89:19-20, 26-27</strong>)</li>



<li>Solomon – (Cf. <strong>2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chronicles 22:7-10</strong>)</li>
</ol>
</li>



<li>Persons who righteously follow God, walking blamelessly before him. (Cf. <strong>Matthew 5:9</strong>)</li>



<li>Persons who are adopted into the family of God through faith in Jesus Christ. (Cf. <strong>John 1:12-13; Romans 8:14-17; Galatians 4:4-7</strong>)</li>
</ul>



<p>(End of excerpt)<br>But there is a specific Son of God mentioned in the Old Testament who is divine<sup><strong><a href="https://biblicalmissiology.org/blog/2013/02/11/son-of-god-in-the-old-testament/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3</a></strong></sup>:</p>

<p>This is the end of part 1, we saw that: 1) The angel of the Lord is divine. 2) The Son of Man is divine. 3) The Son of God is unique and divine. The next part we will do some exegesis on who forgives sins and prophecies about the Messiah.</p>

<p>In this second part of the series we will look at the forgiveness of sins, specifically: who can forgive sins in the Old Testament? Additionally the prophecies of Messiah will be listed, to see who we need to look for and what the signs will be.</p>



<p>To start, who forgives sins:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Praise <strong>the Lord</strong>, my soul, and forget not all his benefits— <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> <strong>who forgives all your sins</strong> and heals all your diseases, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> <strong>who <span style="text-decoration: underline">redeems</span></strong> your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s. <strong>Psalm 103:2-5</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20103%3A2-5&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/psalms/103-2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/Psalms.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗ 102:2-5</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against Him. <strong>Daniel 9:9 NKJV</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel%209%3A9&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/daniel/9-9.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/Daniel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗ 10:9</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Who is a God like You, Pardoning iniquity And passing over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He does not retain His anger forever, Because He delights in mercy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He will again have compassion on us, And will subdue our iniquities. You will cast all our sins Into the depths of the sea. <strong>Micah 7:18-19 NKJV</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=micah%207%3A18-19&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/micah/7-18.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/Micia.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>3</strong></sup> If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you. <strong>Psalm 130:3-4</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20130%3A3-4&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/psalms/130-3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/Psalms.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗ 129:3-4</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Only God forgives sins, while humans <em>can</em> mediate or intercede (<strong>Lv. 4:20, Ex. 32:30-24</strong>, etc.), they can <strong>not</strong> forgive sins.</p>

<p>To conclude, only God can forgive sins, the Messiah will be born from the line of David, He will suffer and die for our transgressions, and be resurrected one the third day. After all these verses we can cross reference with the New Testament to see who Jesus is, what His mission is, His lineage, and His suffering death and resurrection. We will do this in the next part.</p>

<p>There are many more prophecies, but we will not go over all of them here (351 can be found in source <a href="#a1-p3-s1">1</a>, many more elsewhere). In the next part, we will go over the first Christians and their interpretations of Christ and the Scriptures.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Part 4: The Apostles, Disciples, and Early Church Fathers</h4>



<p>Now that we have seen some passages, we can look at how they were interpreted by the Apostles and Early Church Fathers.</p>



<p>First we look at how the Apostles viewed Jesus:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td><sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He was in the beginning with God. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. <strong>John 1:1-3, 14</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1-3%2C%2014&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/john/1-1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/John.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Here the Apostle John makes a distinction between the Word and God (It is good to note that in the New Testament, God usually refers to God the Father). He also clearly shows how the Word was before creation, as well as clarifying who the Word is. Since the Word became flesh, the text can only refer to the Christ.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>And Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” <strong>John 20:28</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%3A28&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/john/20-28.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/John.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In this passage we read what the Apostle Thomas said to Christ when He appeared to Thomas after His death and resurrection. Thomas calls Christ <strong>God</strong> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/2316.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Θεός</strong></a>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><tbody><tr><td>of whom are the fathers and from whom, according to the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, the eternally blessed God. Amen. <strong>Romans 9:5</strong> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%209%3A5&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://biblehub.com/text/romans/9-5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗</strong></a>)(<a href="https://www.armenianchurchlibrary.com/files/easternarmenianbible/Rome.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>∗∗∗</strong></a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
