list looks at scientists and their theological position.</h2>
<p>In the field of science we often hear criticism about Christianity,
yet almost never praise Christianity when it inspires scientists. One
who claims to search for the objective truth should put time in research
before stating something as a fact. The age of enlightenment and the
scientific revolution both are a product of Christian theology, ethics,
epistemology; in general the Christian philosophy. These facts are
overlooked.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>We have heard a lot said about beliefs of the Catholic Church. When
talked about those times,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler" target="_blank">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/JKepler.jpg/330px-JKepler.jpg" alt="Kepler" width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"></a>
atheists scientists like to highlight the supposed fact that the
Catholic Church held a geocentric view of the universe and would ‘get
rid’ of anyone who opposed this view.</p>
<p>Hypocritically, these same scientists will not open the Bible to see
if geocentrism is found <strong>anywhere</strong> in the Bible. So the
notion that scientists used to look at the Bible and at the collected
data, and conclude a geocentric view; is simply false. Because 1) the
Bible is not a science book with any scientific teachings and 2) if one
were to use the Bible as a scientific basis that person is dishonest or
just does not understand the faith.</p>
<p>In conclusion, using the Bible to derive geocentrism is complete
ignorance.</p>

Johannes Kepler was a Christian and wrote about his beliefs in his
works. In his letter to the Bavarian chancellor Herwart von Hohenburg he
writes: <sup style="color: black;"><a href="#res-2" >2</a></sup>
<blockquote>
Those laws [of nature] are within the grasp of the human mind; God
wanted us to recognize them by creating us after his own image so that
we could share in his own thoughts. <sup>SOURCE MISSING SEE
